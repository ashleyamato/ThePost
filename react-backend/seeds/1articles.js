          title: 'What Gives Me Hope',
          summary: "An article about Derek and Nick's journey to building their company PRO-FILE",
          body: "A little over two years ago I began graduate school at the University of San Francisco. I’m a big and firm believer in furthering education, however, when I graduated in December of 2016, the relationships built meant most. \n No other relationship meant more than the one Nick (co-founder) and I built. Nick being from Rio de Janeiro, and me (Derek, co-founder) being from California, was a friendship built on trust and values. The two of us became very close and shared the same humor — sorry to the professors we disturbed. \nOutside of class, when we weren’t working, we played golf. Both of us joined Presidio Golf Club in San Francisco where we had the player’s club membership — this required to play during twilight hours. We’d often talk about life, family, and sports. \nWhen observing our friendship from the outside, you’d think “how are these two friends?” Nick had a background working in banking for many years in Rio, while I had a background playing baseball and working in sports. \nWhat I admired most about Nick was his ability to drop stability (in banking) and move to the United States to pursue his dream of working in sports, which was no easy task being married. While sports served as a platform for our friendship, there were many things I admired more about Nick, which was his ability to connect with other people and gain a serious interest in them. Nick was the mentor of Cohort 42 at University of San Francisco, not due to his experience in the workforce, but due to his ability to listen and give constructive criticism. \nOn the golf course, lessons were no different, where I’d often push questions toward him, for me to gain valuable insight into what it takes to be successful. In my eyes, Nick is a success in the sport industry already, due to his ability to work hard and take on the challenge of United States sport industry. Being an immigrant is difficult, but to be one, fighting for opportunities in sports, which is an already limited industry, is an incredible challenge. Nick would drive back and forth from San Francisco to Sacramento to work in soccer, which would barely cover gas — he defines work ethic and passion. \nDue to this challenge, there was one specific day where Nick and I were complaining about the sport industry — lack of jobs, lack of pay, sports tax to work in the industry, etc. Quickly we felt selfish because how can there be an immense amount of opportunities to work in sports, when there are limited opportunities for athletes to extend their career if they are not professional? \nThis is where the light bulb kicked in for Nick and he bounced the idea of PRO-FILE off of me. Both of us come from a background of family entrepreneurs, luckily, we knew the mentorship and honesty would be there for us. Now it was time to write everything on paper. \nOur next project for grad school was focused on building out PRO-FILE, which included growth strategy, strategic planning, profitability model, research and development, and more. So here we are today, a year later, a registered company and after months worth of development, slowly pushing it out to the public. \nOh and I forgot to mention what we do… we are PRO-FILE Sports, Inc. focused on helping collegiate and un-drafted players create a shared community on our platform, share experiences through editorial and network with leagues domestically & internationally to continue playing in places they wouldn’t otherwise had known. \nTo give a quick example — we currently have friends playing in Australia, Sweden, and domestic leagues. Any athlete often doesn’t know about these opportunities without spending time researching and creating their own personal profile to share with these leagues, which includes stats, video, and information about him or her. It’s our time now to bridge the gap between these teams and athletes that are looking to play longer and looking to fulfill a dream of traveling. \nWe hope to create a community of athletes that bring sports to desolate areas, and hope to disrupt women’s and men’s athletics, particularly in sports that should have opportunities to play further beyond college. \nWhat gives me hope is an opportunity to help young people grow and for these people to know that the PRO-FILE family believes in them. \nWith love, \nDerek",

          body: "Honestly, I was prepared to never work in hockey again. When I went public with my story about struggling with obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression last year, I was terrified that people wouldn’t understand. I was worried that no one would want to hire me ever again, and that doors would close on me — and maybe worst of all, that people in the hockey community would look at me like I was damaged goods, that I would never work in hockey again.\nHonestly, I was prepared to never work in hockey again.

I was worried that no one would want to hire me ever again, and that doors would close on me — and maybe worst of all, that people in the hockey community would look at me like I was damaged goods, that I would never work in hockey again.\nI mean, I wrote about trying to kill myself. I wrote about struggling daily with dark thoughts that wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. I wrote about feeling weak and confused and sad, which is something that hockey players of my generation — and honestly, anyone of my generation — were told was for “crazy people.” In my day, you simply did not talk about mental health. Ever.\nSo before I published my story, I honestly was prepared for the worst. But I shared it with my family and with my kids, and they gave me their blessing and support. I was tired of holding everything inside. I wanted people to know the real me and why I was like that when I was younger. After the story went out into the world, well … my fears couldn’t have been further from reality. I was absolutely blown away by how many people reached out to me through text and email and Twitter to say that they’d struggled with similar thoughts and feelings for years — sometimes decades — and either they didn’t know what was wrong with them, or they were afraid to talk to someone about it.\nWell, I’m not alone. We’re not alone. Mental health awareness is an enormous, unspoken problem — not just in hockey in Canada and the United States, and not just in sports in general, but also across all other spectrums of society.\nAlmost one in five … think about that. About twenty percent of the adult population suffers from mental illness, and just because you are a professional athlete or a doctor or a lawyer does not grant you immunity. Anyone at anytime can suffer from a mental health issue and it can strike at any time.\nThere’s nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about. We’re all just trying to get through the day. So let’s be open. Let’s talk about it.\nIn the past year I’ve been at golf tournaments and other events, and 40- and 50-year-old men have walked up to me right out of the blue, with tears in their eyes, and said, “Thank you.

When you’re with those four guys, something’s always going on. Jason’s looking at me and Brent, kind of like a little kid who can’t contain himself, you know?\nAnd he says, “Lane, tell ’em. Tell ’em, dude.”\nWe’re like, “What? Tell us what?”\nHe says, “Tell ’em what we ordered.”\nAnd so Lane kind of leans across the table all … what’s the word? I guess you’d call it conspiratorial, like it’s Ocean’s Eleven or something. And he’s like, “You know how everyone keeps saying we’re underdogs? Even though we’re the No. 1 seed? Well … we were on Amazon last night, and we ordered these dog masks.”\nAnd I’m kind of confused. I’m like, “What do you mean, like … a puppy?”\nLane says, “No, man. German shepherds. They’re creepy. Real creepy. Two-day shipping. They’re coming tomorrow.”\nBefore I can even think, like, What the heck are you going to do with a creepy dog mask? Lane says, “Yeah, and when we win, because we’re gonna freaking win, we’re going to do everything in the masks. Media. Postgame. Everything. Dogs.”\nChris and Jason don’t even say anything. They’re just nodding, like, Genius, right? Dogs.  \nUnderdogs. No shot. Dead in the water. We heard it about 10,000 times over the course of that week: The first No. 1 seed since 1970 to be ’dogs in the divisional round. It wasn’t just us who embraced it. The whole city embraced it. If you’re an outsider, you probably don’t really get it. But if you’re from Philly, and if you’ve been following this team all year, then you know. It’s not just Carson Wentz who went down. It was Jason Peters and Darren Sproles and Jordan Hicks and Chris Maragos. We could probably field an All-Pro team of injured guys, but instead of crumbling under all the adversity, it only made us more united.h",
